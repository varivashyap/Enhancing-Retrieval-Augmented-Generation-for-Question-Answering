Another post included a screenshot of a message Amazon sent to sellers the day after the FTC filed its complaint, which said, “As your partners, we know that this news may generate questions for you and our business together. This lawsuit does not change anything about our relationship with you or how we operate today.” One user called it “BS verbiage,” adding, “Businesses that sell in their store are indeed customers. And which of us has gotten good customer service?” Another user described their experience in the last 12 months of selling on Amazon as “being up all night at an effing casino but I'm stuck, the drugs are starting to wear off, but I'm trying to break even on the mortgage payment I'm using to play.\n",

      "More importantly, perhaps, is the suit’s tackling of how AI will impact publishers’ businesses. The problem was recently detailed in a report on Thursday by The Wall Street Journal, which led with a shocking statistic. When online magazine The Atlantic modeled what would happen if Google integrated AI into search, it found that 75% of the time the AI would answer the user’s query without requiring a click-through to its website, losing it traffic. This could have a major impact on publishers’ traffic going forward, as Google today drives nearly 40% of their traffic, according to data from Similarweb.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some publishers are now trying to get ahead of the problem. For example, Axel Springer just this week inked a deal with OpenAI to license its news for AI model training. But overall, publishers believe they’ll lose somewhere between 20-40% of their website traffic when Google’s AI products fully roll out, The WSJ’s report noted.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lawsuit reiterates this concern, claiming that Google’s recent advances in AI-based search were implemented with “the goal of discouraging end-users from visiting the websites of Class members who are part of the digital news and publishing line of commerce.”\n",
      "\n",

      "It was already difficult for maritime moisture to penetrate deep into the center of the continent. Rapid greenhouse warming made it even hotter and drier, according both to climate model simulations of the end of the Permian and analyses of the fossil river deposits from Pangean floodplains. The sudden drying would have led to the massive die-off of the tenuous, moisture-dependent forests that had arisen over the course of the Paleozoic. That meant less burial of organic matter on land, assisted perhaps by decreased carbon export to the deep oceans due to a collapsing marine food web. Atmospheric oxygen levels appear to have dropped precipitously as a result, reaching concentrations as low as 15% at the P-T boundary.\n",

      "Treasury yields have been climbing sharply as Wall Street accepts a new normal where the Federal Reserve is likely to keep interest rates high for longer. The Fed is trying to push still-high inflation down to its target, and its main tool of high interest rates does that by trying to slow the economy and hurting prices for investments. The Fed’s main interest rate is at its highest level since 2001, and the central bank indicated last week it may cut interest rates next year by less than it earlier expected. Friday’s economic data shows that not only was inflation a touch cooler than expected in August, so was growth in spending by US consumers. That can be a positive for inflation because it means not as many dollars are pouring into purchases. That in turn could give companies less encouragement to try to raise prices further. But it may also dent what’s been a big driver keeping the US economy out of a recession.\n",

Considering Swift is known for being an Eagles fan – she’s originally from Pennsylvania and even references the team in Gold Rush – her outward support for the Kelce’s team seemed extra telling. Swifties were immediately on high alert, with some capturing Swift and Kelce leaving the stadium together. If that wasn’t enough, extra observant fans were able to note that Kelce’s blue and white post-game outfit was supposedly labelled the “1989 bedroom painting set”, perhaps an intentional reference to Swift’s 2014 album, which she will be re-releasing in October. Swift’s penchant for Easter eggs must be rubbing off on the tight end player. As if this weren’t enough subtle references already, they were also spotted in a “getaway car” together outside the stadium – potentially a nod towards her 2017 track.\n",

      "But eight years later, the argument between the two men seems prescient. The question of whether AI will elevate the world or destroy it – or at least inflict grave damage – has framed an ongoing debate among Silicon Valley founders, chatbot users, academics, legislators and regulators about whether the technology should be controlled or set free. Loading That debate has pitted some of the world’s richest men against one another: Musk, Page, Mark Zuckerberg of Meta, tech investor Peter Thiel, Satya Nadella of Microsoft and Sam Altman of OpenAI. All have fought for a piece of the business – which one day could be worth trillions of dollars – and the power to shape it. At the heart of this competition is a brain-stretching paradox. The people who say they are most worried about AI are among the most determined to create it and enjoy its riches. They have justified their ambition with their strong belief that they alone can keep AI from endangering Earth. Musk and Page stopped speaking soon after the party that summer.\n",

When Mozilla made Yahoo! the default on Firefox, most users changed it to Google. And when people set up a Windows device for the first time they frequently sidestep the Microsoft default — “Google” was the number one search query on Bing in 2021 — despite Microsoft making that very annoying to do.\n",

      "More importantly, perhaps, is the suit’s tackling of how AI will impact publishers’ businesses. The problem was recently detailed in a report on Thursday by The Wall Street Journal, which led with a shocking statistic. When online magazine The Atlantic modeled what would happen if Google integrated AI into search, it found that 75% of the time the AI would answer the user’s query without requiring a click-through to its website, losing it traffic. This could have a major impact on publishers’ traffic going forward, as Google today drives nearly 40% of their traffic, according to data from Similarweb.\n",

      "Some publishers are now trying to get ahead of the problem. For example, Axel Springer just this week inked a deal with OpenAI to license its news for AI model training.

Many, including the three young men from Britain, had a connection to Eliezer Yudkowsky, an internet philosopher and self-taught AI researcher. Yudkowsky was a leader in a community of people who called themselves Rationalists or, in later years, effective altruists. They believed that AI could find a cure for cancer or solve climate change, but they worried that AI bots might do things their creators had not intended. If the machines became more intelligent than humans, the Rationalists argued, the machines could turn on their creators. Thiel had become enormously wealthy through an early investment in Facebook and through his work with Musk in the early days of PayPal. He had developed a fascination with the singularity, a trope of science fiction that describes the moment when intelligent technology can no longer be controlled by humanity.\n",

Years later, a producer offered him the lead in a big film being shot in Britain, but the money men demanded an American star and William Hurt got the gig. When Teale won a Tony Award in 1997 for his performance in Ibsen’s A Doll’s House, he was told he needed to spend time in Hollywood wooing producers. He decided to fly home to his family in London instead. “My wife was about to give birth, so I said ‘I’m off’.

Over the last two decades, US colleges and universities have emphasized policies to protect students.

Today’s academics have become public figures online and in the media in a climate of rising political polarization, racism and misogyny, and attacks on intellectualism. In the digital age, many threats to faculty and staff do not just come from those affiliated with campuses. They can come from individuals anywhere around the world, making harassers harder to track down or punish. Scholars now appear regularly in the press, maintain their own personal webpages, post regularly on social media, and are encouraged to write for broader audiences — these are now the expectations of a job once largely confined to their campus and field.

      "In the months before the murder, various faculty members had reported a history of threats, harassment, and abuse by the student to the university and police. Over the last two decades, US colleges and universities have emphasized policies to protect students. But some within academia are now calling on institutions to do more to defend professors and other staff, who are also commonly targeted. Today’s academics have become public figures online and in the media in a climate of rising political polarization, racism and misogyny, and attacks on intellectualism. In the digital age, many threats to faculty and staff do not just come from those affiliated with campuses. They can come from individuals anywhere around the world, making harassers harder to track down or punish. Scholars now appear regularly in the press, maintain their own personal webpages, post regularly on social media, and are encouraged to write for broader audiences — these are now the expectations of a job once largely confined to their campus and field. The Professor Watchlist, launched in 2016, has grown to include the names of more than nearly 1,000 scholars to its original roster of 200 and includes Angela Davis, Ibram X. Kendi, and Noam Chomsky.\n",

      "More importantly, perhaps, is the suit’s tackling of how AI will impact publishers’ businesses. The problem was recently detailed in a report on Thursday by The Wall Street Journal, which led with a shocking statistic. When online magazine The Atlantic modeled what would happen if Google integrated AI into search, it found that 75% of the time the AI would answer the user’s query without requiring a click-through to its website, losing it traffic. This could have a major impact on publishers’ traffic going forward, as Google today drives nearly 40% of their traffic, according to data from Similarweb.\n",

      "Some publishers are now trying to get ahead of the problem. For example, Axel Springer just this week inked a deal with OpenAI to license its news for AI model training.

Swift’s penchant for Easter eggs must be rubbing off on the tight end player. As if this weren’t enough subtle references already, they were also spotted in a “getaway car” together outside the stadium – potentially a nod towards her 2017 track.

Considering Swift is known for being an Eagles fan – she’s originally from Pennsylvania and even references the team in Gold Rush – her outward support for the Kelce’s team seemed extra telling. Swifties were immediately on high alert, with some capturing Swift and Kelce leaving the stadium together. If that wasn’t enough, extra observant fans were able to note that Kelce’s blue and white post-game outfit was supposedly labelled the “1989 bedroom painting set”, perhaps an intentional reference to Swift’s 2014 album, which she will be re-releasing in October. Swift’s penchant for Easter eggs must be rubbing off on the tight end player. As if this weren’t enough subtle references already, they were also spotted in a “getaway car” together outside the stadium – potentially a nod towards her 2017 track.\n",

Swifties were immediately on high alert, with some capturing Swift and Kelce leaving the stadium together. If that wasn’t enough, extra observant fans were able to note that Kelce’s blue and white post-game outfit was supposedly labelled the “1989 bedroom painting set”, perhaps an intentional reference to Swift’s 2014 album, which she will be re-releasing in October. Swift’s penchant for Easter eggs must be rubbing off on the tight end player. As if this weren’t enough subtle references already, they were also spotted in a “getaway car” together outside the stadium – potentially a nod towards her 2017 track.

      "More importantly, perhaps, is the suit’s tackling of how AI will impact publishers’ businesses. The problem was recently detailed in a report on Thursday by The Wall Street Journal, which led with a shocking statistic. When online magazine The Atlantic modeled what would happen if Google integrated AI into search, it found that 75% of the time the AI would answer the user’s query without requiring a click-through to its website, losing it traffic. This could have a major impact on publishers’ traffic going forward, as Google today drives nearly 40% of their traffic, according to data from Similarweb.\n",

      "Some publishers are now trying to get ahead of the problem. For example, Axel Springer just this week inked a deal with OpenAI to license its news for AI model training.

Years later, a producer offered him the lead in a big film being shot in Britain, but the money men demanded an American star and William Hurt got the gig. When Teale won a Tony Award in 1997 for his performance in Ibsen’s A Doll’s House, he was told he needed to spend time in Hollywood wooing producers. He decided to fly home to his family in London instead. “My wife was about to give birth, so I said ‘I’m off’.

If that wasn’t enough, extra observant fans were able to note that Kelce’s blue and white post-game outfit was supposedly labelled the “1989 bedroom painting set”, perhaps an intentional reference to Swift’s 2014 album, which she will be re-releasing in October. Swift’s penchant for Easter eggs must be rubbing off on the tight end player. As if this weren’t enough subtle references already, they were also spotted in a “getaway car” together outside the stadium – potentially a nod towards her 2017 track.
